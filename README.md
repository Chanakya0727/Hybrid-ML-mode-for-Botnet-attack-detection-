# Hybrid-ML-mode-for-Botnet-attack-detection-
A hybrid machine learning–based system for detecting botnet attacks in IoT environments. The project uses Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and hybrid models to analyze Android device behavior and network activity, delivering accurate, real-time botnet detection via a Flask web app.
